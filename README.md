# Ayush-CS50
Hey, my name is Ayush and this is my submission of project0 in CS50 Web programming with Python and JavaScript.
A brief overview of my project:
I have created a protein related website where you can look over the products and have a certain understanding.
I have met all the requirements asked to make this project0.
From multiple pages to scss nesting/variabes to Bootstrap 4 to css styling and implementations to mobile resposive query to adding tables and ordered/unordered list.
It adds upto all the desired results and kinda looks viewable to the user.
Later i can add some further related changes where user can actually make a purchase and other implementations necessary.
Hope you like my project0. 
Thanks :)
